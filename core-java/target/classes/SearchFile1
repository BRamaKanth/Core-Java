Eclipse Vert.x is event driven and non blocking.
This means your app can handle a lot of concurrency using a small number of kernel threads. Vert.x lets your app scale with minimal hardware.
Vert.x is not a restrictive framework or container and we don't tell you a correct way to write an application. Instead we give you a lot of
useful bricks and let you create your app the way you want to.
